## ðŸ›  How It Works

- **API Used**: [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io)  
  Huge shoutout to **Quotable** for providing an amazing free API for random quotes!

- **Fetching a Quote**:
  - On page load and when you click "New Quote", a new quote is fetched from the Quotable API using `fetch()`.
  - The quote text and author name are updated dynamically.

- **Tweeting the Quote**:
  - Clicking the "Tweet" button opens a Twitter sharing window with the quote and author pre-filled.
